First, since there are no roads we depend on canals, rivers and lakes for our travel routes. Most families have a boat of their own. Children often learn to swim at least as early as they learn to walk-you are likely to see kids splashing in the local equivalent of a playground. Their school buses float, as do the postal vessels delivering to homes here. Even the supermarket floats!River Escapes provides an experience of the backwaters of Kerala in a vessel whose history harkens back to the ancient rice trade of this region while also providing modern comforts. These vessels are designed to balance authenticity and innovation. They are engineered to balance comfort and environmental responsibility - we pioneered the technology now considered the gold standard of emissions reduction. Most importantly they are staffed by members of the local community who are proud to showcase their corner of God's Own Country to visitors.A unique set of waterways in our state's central region allows us to showcase three districts that represent the ""rice bowl"" of Kerala - all by boat. We started operating our houseboats in 2006 and are now the respected leader on the backwaters in terms of environmental responsibility, commitment to the communities where we bring visitors and in terms of guest satisfaction.","('Ambalapuzha Sree Krishna Temple', 'Kerala Backwaters', 'Alleppey Backwaters', 'Revi Karunakaran Museum')","A.C.

Was travelling with 3 Senior citizens and a 4 year old kid..So if you are going to travel with the same set of people, think twice before you book here..And here we aren't talking about niggling things here and there which every hotel has and which is pretty much acceptable..The screw up is of large proportions.. To start with the hotel location is an hour away from the main market..Fine they can't be blamed for that...You reach there and the property is pretty well spread and neat...but the service is so so so below average...would say poor...Most of the rooms are at a climb which makes it difficult for senior citizens ..but don't worry the hotel arranges for a Jeep for commuting from one place to the other...but again..the Jeep isn't available at beck and call..the time you need it there's always a 15-30 minute wait for the driver or the availability of the Jeep. No wifi in a room that we had booked..no explanation offered. No milk available with the restaurant...How can a hotel have no milk...if you have kids who consume milk 80% of the time, think again...Geyser/Water heater in a room that we had booked wasn't working for all of the 2.5 days that we were here..Coming go the food..Anything that you order with their I house restaurant takes 45 minutes to an hour(here I'm talking about a time when the Corona virus rumours had started taking measurable shape)..So I could count the number of families on my fingertips ...Even after 45 minutes of trying to talk everything on this Earth,the food is delivered to disappoint...The food menu boasts of 200+ items out of which 180 wouldn't be available or the waiter would have to ask the chef of it's available or not... Another big screw up is non availability of a doctor on call...Fine..if you don't have a doctor atleast have a medical kit which also wasnt available...Forget a medical kit they also did not have basic things like eno... The recreation room has a table tennis table with a ball which is not a table tennis ball(maybe I'm asking fog too much here),a carrom table (with no powder /maintenance),a chess board and a snooker table (which is chargeable).. To 'summ it's up , look for better hotels..Check with people who have travelled to hotels and don't get filled like we did trusting the online reviews.

Cannon balls once fired out from its thick bastion-walls. This scallop-walled twin-house looks rather like a ship and indeed, boats were brought in on high tide and parked downstairs in its stable and dry dock! Since 1982, it is owned by Peirce Leslie. The character of The Tower House lies in its unpretentious yet proud bearing, almost grandfather like, it sits looking out over the sea, a spirit of adventure surrounds it even today, taking one back to stories of high seas told and retold over centuries. Stately colonial pillars hold up its vast, high-ceilinged halls. The generous arched doors welcoming one to step in to another world where time stretches, pauses to watch the sun set, and then moves ever so lightly towards dawn. Yes it’s the magic of spaces that have seen more history than we will ever see, spaces that we know will still be there to delight those who come long after us. The furniture is an eclectic mix with no attempt to recreate rooms of any one era or type because the residential structure was added on to. It’s the light pouring in through the windows, skylights and the vastness of the indoor spaces that make for an unforgettable experience. Most of the rooms have large four poster beds, and bathrooms that happily accommodate large tubs. The windows have views of the trees or the sea depending on where they are located. Restored to be compatible with present-day needs while maintaining its structural integrity, it reflects different periods rather than artificially being faithful to any single one. It takes you back in time, as moods and memories woven together create a fabric that is strong but sits ever so lightly. The above uncompromising principles of practical use of material and form dictated The Tower House renovation too and its adherence to these very values of being honest to the time we live in while respecting the past that has set new standards in heritage tourism. Discover the old world charm where, sailors, travellers, traders, planters feasted and danced under chandeliers, suspended from high wooden ceilings.","('Kashi Art Gallery', 'Kerala Kathakali Centre', 'David Hall Gallery & Cafe', 'Kochi Books')","Neemrana's Tower 1/320 Neemrana's Tower House Tower Road Fort Kochi, Kochi (Cochin) 682001 India",(Cochin),9.9655551,76.2414371

Written on the banks of a tranquil lake. You find the island of silence just 17 km from Kochi, Kerala's metropolis, and 2 km from a busy national highway. The Kumbalam backwaters is part of the famed Vembanad Lake. As the gates open, a sudden change in landscape, a riot of greenery, and silence, greet you. A harmonious mix of exhibitive desert trees and the natural flora of Kerala instil in you the same feeling you experience while watching your child take its first steps: excitement! Pass through the front office that exudes the Keralan hospitality, laced with the professionalism of Ramada, and walk into one of those 24 pool-facing villas. The long walk itself is a refreshing change, compared with boxing oneself into the usual elevator. The greenery soothes the nerves of even a weary traveller. You have started experiencing the space. And silence. Oh! Its space everywhere. Spread across 7 acres of land, Ramada Resort has only 42 living spaces. You would perhaps enjoy the largest per capita space on a resort in Kerala! Before stepping into your room, you find the ground floor is just floor, and not a room! Your kids may want to stay back and play. Let them, and you allow yourself into your cottage. In the super luxury of the room, you will come across the best amenities. Open the glass door and step into the balcony. The meandering pool stretches itself to 110 metres in front of you. Its waters almost touch the lake, which touches the eastern horizon for sure. The enormous expanse of the backwater, lined with coconut trees, will make you feel the thrill of floating freely on a ship's deck, a la Jack and Rose. It's a play of water, mixed with serenity. You feel engulfed by infinity. Almost. In the morning, the sun rising from across the waters will greet you on the balcony. You may feel like doing a sun-salutation, the most beneficial yoga posture. The fisherman in his canoe rowing against the myriad hues of morning sun will be a picture postcard scene that reminds you of the painting competition in your school days. In the evening, the reflections of the setting sun on the serene waters would take you to the empire of silence. The water, layers and layers of it, may tempt you to try some water therapy. Walk into the spa, Kerala's largest. It offers more than 25 varieties of herbal and western massages. Treat yourself to foot reflexology and leave the seat with every organ in your body relaxed. Or try Thai massage. Or Balinese. Treat your senses to the aroma of freshly fried seafood. With your stomach directing you towards the restaurant, the turn in the corridor next to it opens up suddenly into an empty expanse of greenery. The deja vu feeling of having one's own extra space suddenly overpowers the unassuming traveller. It takes some time to adjust to this heavenly feeling and finally when lunch is served, you realise even time has no boundaries in this part of the world and stands still.","('Shiva Temple', 'Kerala Folklore Museum', 'Mattancherry', 'Jew Town')","P.V.

The room was sea facing and within 20 meters, we had our own private beach. I was truly happy that we went ahead with this property for stay.  The manager Mukundan was quite helpful, arranged a rick, took care of our food and even managed to wake us up for a 2.30 midnight Theyyam performance. We were 2 girls and they made sure we were safe :) That's the biggest plus i guess. The food was super yum and it was made as per request.

In the name of malaikari, a dish to be prepared with coconut and it's milk, we were served a red hot dish with gravy having a plentiful of onion and 'panch foron'.The prawns were far from fresh.  On enquiring about the room booking, the people busy in their computers, handed me a leaflet with no tariff information. We were asked to visit the website printed there.

Nestling under a canopy of towering Jamun trees, barely a hundred metres from Lake Charlotte and close to popular points like One Tree Hill, Echo Point etc, this stately colonial building was painstakingly restored by Francis Wacziarg, an Indophile French connoisseur and today is the favourite haunt of Mumbai’s eclectic mix of artistes, intelligentsia and the well-heeled, who want to get away from the stress of hectic city life and the relentless onslaught of information, the blessing as well as the bane of modern life. So iconic is the grand veranda that Barr House is today known as the “Verandah in the forest”. Sink into a world of colonial charm with no interference from technology and reconnect with nature and oneself. In the evenings try a perennial Parsi favourite, Dhansak and brown rice or tuck into a rich home-made chocolate ice-cream or better still, a fresh jamun ice-cream made with jamun collected from the towering trees in the estate. Or play scrabble in the stately Dubash hall, curled up on one of the sofas, sipping a cup of Cona coffee made with organic coffee straight from our plantations in Kodaikanal, listening to the philharmonic of nature, or enjoy a cup of tea with a slice of matured plum cake in true colonial style. The kitchens dish out hearty Continental and Mediterranean fare as well as earthy Marathi dishes from around the region. Better still; enjoy a four course candle light dinner in the communal dining hall, at the ancient 18 seater oak table. Barr House has a character which has remained firmly rooted in its colonial past and is immersed in the natural splendour of Matheran.","('Louisa Point', 'Porcupine Point (Sunset Point)', 'Charlotte Lake', 'Panorama Point')","Charlotte Lake Road, Matheran 410102 India",Matheran,,

Capital O 4979 near Kamakhya Railway Station,,2.0,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)Free breakfastChildren Activities (Kid / Family Friendly),"If you need to catch a train from Kamakhya Railway station early in the morning and are looking to stay the night at a place somewhere near, this is just the place for you. Kamkhya Railway Station is a little more than half a kilometre from here. But that is where all good things about this property ends. Located beside the Maligaon flyover, this property is located on the 3rd floor of a building that houses a diagnostic centre on the first and second floors. I don't now if its a problem with the property or something else, but electricity in this place keeps playing hide and seek. There are power cuts every 10 mins approximately, during the day. We faced this harsh reality when out lift got stuck midway on our way up after our arrival. After getting stuck for nearly 10 minutes the power came back on and we reached the reception. Check in was smooth and we were shown to Room number 105 and 110. A stinky smell strikes you the moment you enter the room. The only saving grace was a functional AC. The bed linen was not clean, the pillows tried their best to replicate the feel of the pillows provided by the Indian Railways, where you head is virtually on the bed and not raised up by a pillow. No towels or toiletries were provided in the rooms. On asking for towels, the middle aged person manning the reception, only managed a wry smile and did not say a word. Cockroaches and bugs were aplenty. Basins and commodes were dirty. Jugs were there in the room but no one cared to fill it even once. You can order food in the room. Regarding the food....the lesser said, the better. It was terrible to say the least. The rice provided almost seemed stale. Breakfast is provided free, but after the experience with dinner, the night before, I could not gather the courage to try it.  I have always preferred OYO for my hotel stays as they adhere to strict quality standards and strive to provide customers with a good experience. But, this property does not deserve to be a a certified OYO property. OYO should seriously consider severing their ties with this property. Will never recommend this property to anyone and would certainly not go back again. The newly constructed retiring rooms at Kamakhya Station would be my priority next time.…",,"Near Flyover, Maligaon Chariali, Guwahati 781012 India",Guwahati,,
